			<h1> Lebanon in Crosshairs as Saudi-Iran Tension Soar </h3>

			<p class = 'text'> The Middle East is entering what many analysts see as a dangerous new phase. With the Islamic State group on the brink of defeat, the long-simmering rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran threatens to boil over, with Lebanon in the crosshairs.</p>

			<p class = 'text'> The Lebanese Prime Minister, Saad Hariri, unexpectedly quit last weekend. </p>

			<p class = 'text'> He made his announcement not from Lebanon but in Saudi Arabia, the country that acts as his political backer. Many Lebanese believe he was pushed into the decision by Riyadh. </p>

			<p class = 'text'> The spectacle of the missing prime minister is being seen as part of the wider regional struggle between Sunni-ruled Saudi Arabia and Shia-dominated Iran. </p>

			<p class = 'text'> For now, Lebanon is uncomfortably centre stage - it is after all where proxy wars have been fought in the past. </p>

			<p class = 'text'> Iran backs the Shia movement Hezbollah here. Its supporters believe Mr Hariri's resignation was orchestrated by the Saudis in order to weaken their influence in the country. </p>

			<p class = 'text'> On Thursday, Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies further ratcheted up the pressure by urging their citizens to leave Lebanon, sending a clear signal of a toughening up of its policy towards the country. </p>

			<h2> 'On the brink' </h2>

			<p class = 'text'> Meddling in Lebanon's affairs by great powers is nothing new. But the fear is a misstep now could trigger something far graver. </p>

			<p class = 'text'> "In the last few decades, we've never been so close to the precipice," warns Maha Yahya, director of the Carnegie Middle East Center think-tank. </p>

			<p class = 'text'> "The threat of a regional war has never been this real where a conflict would involve a variety of different countries." </p>

			<p class = 'text'> And that is why what happens in Lebanon matters to us all. </p>

			<p class = 'text'> The so-called Islamic State group is all but defeated. What is happening now though - the growing rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran - could be even more dangerous for the region and beyond. </p>
